# Bike-Sharing-Demand-Prediction
Seoul Bike Sharing Demand Prediction
AlmaBetter Verfied Project seoul

📋 Problem Statement
Currently Rental bikes are introduced in many urban cities for the enhancement of mobility comfort. It is important to make the rental bike available and accessible to the public at the right time as it lessens the waiting time. Eventually, providing the city with a stable supply of rental bikes becomes a major concern. The crucial part is the prediction of bike count required at each hour for the stable supply of rental bikes.

Data Description
The dataset contains weather information (Temperature, Humidity, Windspeed, Visibility, Dewpoint, Solar radiation, Snowfall, Rainfall), the number of bikes rented per hour and date information.

Data Pipeline
● Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): In this part we have done some EDA on the features to see the trend.

● Data Processing: In this part we went through each attributes and encoded the categorical features.

● Model Creation: Finally in this part we created the various models. These various models are being analysed and we tried to study various models so as to get the best performing model for our project.

📋 Execution Instruction
The order of execution of the colab notebook is as follows:

1) Bike_Sharing_Demand_Prediction_Capstone_Project.ipynb

First, click on the open in colab button present on the top centre of the notebook.

In this .ipynb file, we have -

• EDA on Bike sharing demand prediction.

• Hypothesis.

• Fitting different models and cross validate them.

2) Kaggle Dataset

Downlaod the dataset from kaggle through provided link.Then, connect to the runtime and execute the cell to mount the drive or upload the data file to the current runtime.

3) Cell Path

Finally, delete the path in the dataset loading cell and replace it with the path of your current data file. Run each cell to see the output below it.

📘 Algorithms Used
Linear Regression
Lasso and Ridge Regression
Decision tree
Random Forest
Gradient Boosting
Conclusions
● When we compare the root mean squared error and mean absolute error of all the models, the random forest regression model has less root mean squared error and mean absolute error, ending with the R-squared of 99% . So, finally this model is best for predicting the bike rental count on daily basis.

● For all the models, temperature or hour was ranked as the most influential variable to predict the rental bike demand at each hour.
